</strong>Find a study partner and schedule regular meetings. Get your study partners in the habit of reviewing
class material, working problems all the way through and talking about the "why" behind the answers.
Practicing and continually practicing is key to mastering the learning objectives. If you get stuck,
come to my office or e-mail me (see how to email me below). I'll be encouraged by your efforts and glad
to help. </p>
